## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

The following are my favorite applications and the features that make them my favorite app: 

- Instagram: adding music to post & stories, double tap, and quick replies on stories 
- Facebook: marketplace & music to posts
- Tiktok: endless scroll, clear display feature, and tiktok shop

The following is an app I would like to build: 

A budgeting app that helps users track their spending and set budgets. Instead of simply viewing expenses as a list or in a summary format, users can see their expenses in a calendar view. Each transaction is shown as a date on the calendar with the category and amount spent. Users can set recurring expenses (rent, subscriptions) so that theyâ€™re automatically added on the calendar or in the budget. Users can set specific budget limits for different categories on a weekly or monthly basis.

## Notes

A challenge I faced was adding the image. I noticed it wasn't a matter of simply drag and dropping the image onto the screen. However, I then found you could add the image as an asset and add it to the view controller to hide/unhide the image when necessary.
